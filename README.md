# TerminalCalculator

Simply type an expression and the code will spit out its parsed token array, its postfix and the evaluated result.

The result displays both **integers**, **floats** and **fractions** when applicable.

Whitespaces don't matter and there is simple error handling (for most edge cases)

This is meant for educational purposes.
